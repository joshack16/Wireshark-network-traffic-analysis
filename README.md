# Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates network traffic capture and analysis using Wireshark to identify common protocols, inspect packet contents, and detect potential security risks.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Wireshark
- TCP/IP Networking
- Windows/Linux OS

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Protocol identification
- DNS traffic inspection
- HTTP vs HTTPS comparison
- SYN packet analysis

## 🔐 Security Insights
- DNS queries expose browsing behavior
- HTTP traffic is readable and insecure
- Excessive SYN packets may indicate scanning activity

## 📁 Project Structure
- `captures/` – Packet capture files
- `screenshots/` – Evidence of analysis
- `analysis/` – Detailed written report
